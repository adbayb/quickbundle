## ‚ú® Features

Quickbundle allows you to bundle a library in a **quick**, **fast** and **easy** way:

-   Fast build and watch mode thanks to [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)
-   Zero configuration: define the build artifacts in your `package.json` and you're all set!
-   Support of multiple module formats including `cjs` & `esm`
-   JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, CSS, JSON, Image and Text support following [esbuild support](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/)
-   TypeScript declaration file (`.d.ts`) generation with bundling support
-   Optimized build with automatic dependency inclusion (`peerDependencies` and `dependencies` are not bundled in the final output)
